##Brisket - because the data is better when it's cooked low and slow

###About
This repository serves as a collection of frontend scripts to control <a href="https://github.com/robertdavidgraham" target="new">Robert David Graham</a>'s asynchronous TCP port scanner, <a href="https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan" target="new">masscan</a>. From the masscan page:

> It produces results similar to nmap, the most famous port scanner. Internally, it operates 
> more like scanrand, unicornscan, and ZMap, using asynchronous transmission. The major 
> difference is that it's faster than these other scanners. In addition, it's more flexible, 
> allowing arbitrary address ranges and port ranges.
